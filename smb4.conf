# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options (perhaps too
# many!) most of which are not shown in this example
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash)
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
# for commentry and a ; for parts of the config file that you
# may wish to enable
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command &quot;testparm&quot;
# to check that you have not many any basic syntactic errors.
#
#======================= Global Settings =====================================
[global]

# workgroup = NT-Domain-Name or Workgroup-Name
   workgroup = MELTDOWN

# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
   server string = Samba Server on Caldera OpenLinux

# This option is important for security. It allows you to restrict
# connections to machines which are on your local network. The
# following example restricts access to two C class networks and
# the &quot;loopback&quot; interface. For more examples of the syntax see
# the smb.conf man page

# If you want to automatically load your printer list rather
# than setting them up individually then you'll need this
   load printers = no

# you may wish to override the location of the printcap file

# It should not be necessary to specify the print system type unless
# it is non-standard. Currently supported print systems include:
# bsd, sysv, plp, lprng, aix, hpux, qnx
   printing = cups

# Uncomment this if you want a guest account, you must add this to /etc/passwd
# otherwise the user &quot;nobody&quot; is used

# this tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects
  log file = /var/log/samba.d/smb.%m

# Put a capping on the size of the log files (in Kb).
   max log size = 200

# Security mode. Most people will want user level security. See
# security_level.txt for details.
   security = user
# Use password server option only with security = server

# Password Level allows matching of _n_ characters of the password for
# all combinations of upper and lower case.
  password level = 8
  username level = 8

# You may wish to use password encryption. Please read
# ENCRYPTION.txt, Win95.txt and WinNT.txt in the Samba documentation.
# Do not enable this option unless you have read those documents
  encrypt passwords = yes
  smb passwd file = /etc/samba.d/smbpasswd

# The following are needed to allow password changing from Windows to
# update the Linux sytsem password also.
# NOTE: Use these with 'encrypt passwords' and 'smb passwd file' above.
# NOTE2: You do NOT need these to allow workstations to change only
#        the encrypted SMB passwords. They allow the Unix password
#        to be kept in sync with the SMB password.

# Unix users can map to different SMB User names
  username map = /etc/samba.d/smbusers

# Using the following line enables you to customise your configuration
# on a per machine basis. The %m gets replaced with the netbios name
# of the machine that is connecting

# Most people will find that this option gives better performance.
# See speed.txt and the manual pages for details
   socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192

# Configure Samba to use multiple interfaces
# If you have multiple network interfaces then you must list them
# here. See the man page for details.

# Configure remote browse list synchronisation here
#  request announcement to, or browse list sync from:
#       a specific host or from / to a whole subnet (see below)
# Cause this host to announce itself to local subnets here

# Browser Control Options:
# set local master to no if you don't want Samba to become a master
# browser on your network. Otherwise the normal election rules apply

# OS Level determines the precedence of this server in master browser
# elections. The default value should be reasonable
   os level = 20

# Domain Master specifies Samba to be the Domain Master Browser. This
# allows Samba to collate browse lists between subnets. Don't use this
# if you already have a Windows NT domain controller doing this job

# Preferred Master causes Samba to force a local browser election on startup
# and gives it a slightly higher chance of winning the election

# Use only if you have an NT server on your network that has been
# configured at install time to be a primary domain controller.

# Enable this if you want Samba to be a domain logon server for
# Windows95 workstations.

# if you enable domain logons then you may want a per-machine or
# per user logon script
# run a specific logon batch file per workstation (machine)
# run a specific logon batch file per username

# Where to store roving profiles (only for Win95 and WinNT)
#        %L substitutes for this servers netbios name, %U is username
#        You must uncomment the [Profiles] share below
# Note: &quot;logon home&quot; is for Win9X/ME clients
#       &quot;logon path&quot; is for WinNT/2K/XP clients
   logon home = \\%L\Profiles\%U
   logon path = \\%L\Profiles\%U

   dns proxy = no


#============================ Share Definitions ==============================
[homes]
   comment = Home Directories
   path = %H/Samba
   valid users = %S
   users = %S
   only user = yes
   browseable = no
   writable = yes
   create mask = 0750

   printable = no
# access may be controlled by these options

# Other examples.
#
# This one is useful for people to share files, BUT
# access to '/tmp' or '/var/tmp' should *not* be given lightly,
# as this can (still) pose a security threat!
# Better use a dedicate sub-directory to /(var/)tmp or something
# like a [public] share!
[tmp]
   comment = Temporary file space

# A private printer, usable only by fred. Spool data will be placed in fred's
# home directory. Note that fred must have write access to the spool directory,
# wherever it is.

# A private directory, usable only by fred. Note that fred requires write
# access to the directory.

# a service which has a different directory for each machine that connects
# this allows you to tailor configurations to incoming machines. You could
# also use the %u option to tailor it by user name.
# The %m gets replaced with the machine name that is connecting.

# A publicly accessible directory, read/write to all users. Note that all files
# created in the directory by users will be owned by the default user, so
# any user with access can delete any other user's files. Obviously this
# directory must be writable by the default user. Another user could of course
# be specified, in which case all files would be owned by that user instead.

# The following two entries demonstrate how to share a directory so that two
# users can place files there that will be owned by the specific users. In this
# setup, the directory should be writable by both users and should have the
# sticky bit set on it to prevent abuse. Obviously this could be extended to
# as many users as required.
